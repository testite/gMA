Most popular diets</strong><p><span><i>In the spring, the topic of weight loss becomes relevant for many people, because by the summer you want to lose the pounds accumulated over the winter, become thinner and more elegant. Here are a few diets that have become quite popular in recent years years.</i></span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Fashion for slimness. Most popular diets</span></figcaption></figure><div><div></div></div><p><span><b>Keto diet. Carbohydrates are not allowed</b></span></p><p><span>This diet is based on eating foods that are high in fat and moderate in protein, while high-carb foods are completely natural exclude. The name of the diet comes from the word "ketosis" – a process in which, due to a lack of carbohydrates, there is an intense burning of fat.</span></p><p><span>Before you-the menu of the classic keto diet as a reference point for making an individual nutrition scheme. This plan is suitable for those who are ready to dive into a diet without a long buildup. In the keto diet, it is important to count calories. We recommend downloading a special app (try the Chronometer and KetoDiet App) that automates all calculations and makes them as accurate as possible. </span></p><p><span><b>Breakfast. </b></span><span>Delay Breakfast time until you feel a noticeable hunger. Gradually increase the interval between dinner and Breakfast (it can go up to 18 hours). So, you can drink coffee with a tablespoon of butter, coconut oil and eat three boiled or fried eggs on a tablespoon of coconut oil, in which you can add zucchini or spinach.</span></p><p><span><b>Lunch.</b></span><span> A couple of hours after after Breakfast, eat a salad consisting of half an avocado, lettuce leaves, grated cheese, and 200 grams of chicken, fish, or lean lamb.</span></p><p><span><b>Snack.</b></span><span> Between main meals, you can treat yourself to avocado, celery and nuts. </span></p><p><span><b>Supper. </b></span><span>Eat salmon at least three hours before bedtime, beef or chicken cooked with a high proportion of fat, lard, or ghee, as well as low-carb vegetables seasoned with olive, butter, or coconut oil.</span></p><p><span><i><b>Nuances</b></i></span></p><p><span>The diet is ideal for those who do not imagine their life without meat. The positive aspect of this method of nutrition is due to due to the fact that ketone bodies are formed in the body, there is no feeling of hunger. If you decide to stick to this diet, do not forget to control the caloric content of dishes: if it is exceeded, you will not lose weight, but get better.</span></p><p><span><i><b>Before you start</b></i></span></p><p><span>You don't need to try this diet if your life is at a given moment the moment is associated with active brain activity. The absence of glucose as the main source of energy can lead to reduced performance, rapid fatigue and even cause fainting.</span></p><p><span>In addition, an increase in the amount of proteins can provoke the formation of kidney stones. Still the diet is not recommended for those, those who have problems with joints. Also, be prepared for the fact that your body may start to emit the smell of acetone, so take a shower more often.</span></p><p><span><b>Paleo diet. According to ancient people's recipes</b></span></p><p><span>The diet is based on the use of simple products that were consumed by ancient people: heat-treated meat and fish, nuts, vegetables, and fruits. The menu for a week can be varied, focusing on your own taste. The main rule: the diet should include products only from the permitted list.</span></p><p><span><b>Monday</b></span></p><p><span>Breakfast: scrambled eggs with greens.</span></p><p><span>Lunch: soup with meat broth with tomatoes, boiled meat, broccoli.</span></p><p><span>Dinner: vegetable salad and boiled fish.</span></p><p><span><b>Tuesday</b></span></p><p><span>Breakfast: boiled eggs.</span></p><p><span>Lunch: broth on chicken meat with the addition of breast, salad of vegetables.</span></p><p><span>Dinner: vegetable casserole with mushrooms.</span></p><p><span><b>Wednesday</b></span></p><p><span>Breakfast: assorted berries.</span></p><p><span>Lunch: soup with the addition of celery and nuts, boiled meat and vegetable salad.</span></p><p><span>Dinner: baked vegetables, boiled eggs.</span></p><p><span><b>Thursday </b></span></p><p><span>Breakfast: beef jerky, nuts.</span></p><p><span>Lunch: 150-200 g of boiled salmon, salad with fresh vegetables.</span></p><p><span>Dinner: 400 g of steamed broccoli and cauliflower.</span></p><p><span><b>Friday </b></span></p><p><span>Breakfast: fried eggs with spinach.</span></p><p><span>Lunch: soup prepared with fish broth, vegetables with baked lean meat.</span></p><p><span>Dinner: salted fish (herring or mackerel), boiled vegetables.</span></p><p><span><b>Saturday</b></span></p><p><span>Breakfast: boiled eggs, fresh peppers and tomatoes.</span></p><p><span>Lunch: soup in meat broth, boiled liver with vegetable salad.</span></p><p><span>Dinner: mushroom stew.</span></p><p><span><b>Sunday</b></span></p><p><span>Breakfast: low-fat boiled or stewed meat.</span></p><p><span>Lunch: boiled chicken and vegetable stew.</span></p><p><span>Dinner: fried fish of low-fat varieties, broccoli.</span></p><p><span>In between meals, you should drink clean water (the total amount per day is not less than 1.5-2 liters). Between all meals, snacks are necessary: fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts.</span></p><p><span><i><b>Nuances</b></i></span></p><p><span>The positive aspect is that all products are natural and do not have refined components and hydrogenated fats in their composition. Basically, a diet it can be considered as a start to a healthy diet, because on it a person excludes fast food with various preservatives, taste enhancers and synthetic fats from their diet.</span></p><p><span><i><b>Before you start</b></i></span></p><p><span>The diet is harmful due to insufficient carbohydrate content. In practice, this means that its followers will suffer from irritability, rapid fatigue. In addition, the body will begin to flush out sodium.
